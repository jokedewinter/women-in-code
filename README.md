# Women in code

Website content for the BT Code First Girls web development module. 

Take any of the three folders and convert the text file into a valid HTML document. Use the image provided, or add others. Then apply CSS to style the page however you feel like it.

You can choose to do a one-page site for each of the women, or spread the content over several pages. The choice is yours. 
Try and use as many different HTML tags as you can, but don't loose sight of the semantic meaning of the tags versus the content enclose inside it.
